 * Class holding an IPv4 packet.
 * It contains the content of the packet (member array packet_data) along with two other
 * important members:
 * - data_size: the number of valid unsigned chars in packet_data. It is smaller
 * 		than the size of meaningful data starting at the address of an IpPacket object.
 * 		The latter can be computed by<br>
 * 			sizeof(unsigned int) + sizeof(sc_time) + data_size
 * - received: The time when the packet was received at the receive MAC FIFO.
 * 		Used for latency statistics.
