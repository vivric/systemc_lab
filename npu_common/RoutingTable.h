/**
 * Lookup table for IP packet routing.
 * It does not implement any dynamic discovery mechanism, it works
 * with a static set of routing rules.
 *
 * It uses a configuration file which defines the routing table entries.
 * The lines of the table take the following form:
  @verbatim
   <network address> | <subnet mask> | <tx MAC port ID>
  @endverbatim
 * Lines beginning with '#' and empty lines are skipped. An example configuration
 * file may look like this:
  @verbatim
   # network address | subnet mask | next hop address (MAC port ID, 0..3)
   127.0.0.0 | 255.255.0.0 | 3
   192.168.0.1 | 255.255.255.255 | 0
   192.168.0.0 | 255.255.255.248 | 1
   192.168.0.11| 255.255.255.255 | 2
   192.168.0.0 | 255.255.255.0   | 3
   139.133.0.0 | 255.255.0.0     | 2
   0.0.0.0 | 0.0.0.0 | 3
